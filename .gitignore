# Deciding to ignore stock video folder generally if it contains large files, 
# but the user might want the assets to be part of the repo if they are small.
# Given "stock_video" usually implies raw assets, I'll exclude it if it's heavy, 
# but for a "pipeline" repo, often you want the *code* and *config*, not the gigabytes of assets.
# I will comment it out by default but add the directory to the ignore list to be safe.
